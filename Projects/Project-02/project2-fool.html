			<p> The Fool is young and vulnerable. They have not yet experienced the ups and downs of life, leaving them unaware of the magnitude of life's challenges, as well as the potential they holds. When The Fool comes up in a Tarot reading, you are encouraged to take on their open, willing energy and embrace all that lies ahead of you without worry.</p>
